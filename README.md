  ## Description:
  - I built this project in order to solve the issue of creating a new README.md for every project I make. Most of my READMEs have a consistent structure anyway, so this project will save me a lot of time in putting together a README every time I push a newproject to GtHub. i
  - This project solves the problem of inconsistent formatting across my READMEs, of wasted time on many projects, and of potentially improper licensing on some projects.
  - This project taught me both about fully proper licensing with a variety of software licenses and about what is and is not possible within string literals. I also learned a bit about efficiently handling input with inquirer.prompt.
  - This README creator is unique in that it goes the extra mile with licensing to create a full LICENSE.txt file for any project alongside basic licensing information in the README.

  ## Installation:
  As this project is for developers already familiar with coding, instructions here will assume basic knowledge of command line programs. First, clone this software to a local repository using the ssh link on the main page of this repo. Then, ensure [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is installed. Third, use npm i to install all dependencies.

  ## Usage:
  Run this project by opening a terminal and typing node index.js. Provide all information as asked for in the writing style you prefer to see on your README.

  ## Outside Resources
